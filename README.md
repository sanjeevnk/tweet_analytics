tweet_analytics
===============

Find meta-information about the tweets.

Meta information about a person’s tweets largely includes information that’s based on one or more of:
a) Content of the Tweet (Video, Text, Image, URL’s etc)
b) User Attribute (Age, Gender, Location, Followers, Following, Topics)
c) User Action (Retweet, Reply, Expand, Tag, Favorite, Follow, View Conversation, Browse Content (Click on URL and tags in a tweet)).

My approach is presented in terms of Design Considerations, Notes; Domain Model, Object Model, Persistence Model and Implementation Notes.
